# Android Courses @ Udacity

&nbsp;

The sections below include all of Udacity's Android-related courses, including their [**Android Basics**](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803) & [**Android Developer**](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801) Nanodegree material.

The [**complete course list**](https://www.udacity.com/courses/android) is presently lacking a linear curriculum, so this reference aims to provide a clear, easy to follow path based on each course's prerequisites. The course order in the "*Full Curriculum*" sections is structured so that inidividuals with no prior programming experience can work through them from start to finish.

All of the [**courses can be taken for free**](http://imgur.com/a/GoLJF); although the paid Nanodegree programs do offer [**additional benefits**](#how-do-the-nanodegree-programs-work).

&nbsp;

> ### Is there any kind of support network available for the courses?

Yes. Udacity offers [**official course forums**](https://discussions.udacity.com/c/standalone-courses) that are accessible to all students ( *both free & paid* ).

Additionally, students enrolled in the paid Nanodegree programs will be given access to an exclusive Slack network. Nanodegree students also have access to an optional [**UConnect**](https://www.udacity.com/uconnect) program ( *$99/month* ), where they will receive additional support.

&nbsp; 

> ### Are Nanodegree projects & lessons included in the free courses?

Yes. See [**this article**](https://udacity.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/208018403-Are-Nanodegree-course-and-project-lessonss-available-for-free) on Udacity's support page.

&nbsp; 

> ### How do the Nanodegree programs work?

Nanodegrees provide a curriculum which consists of multiple courses & various projects.

Some of the benefits include:

* a Google-accredited certificate of completion
* code reviews & guidance by Google-certified instructors
* access to a Nanodegree-exclusive Slack network
* guaranteed job eligibility ( [***Nanodegree Plus***](https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree/plus) )

[**Android Basics**](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803):  
> We built this program with Google specifically to support aspiring Android Developers with no programming experience. Our goal is to ensure you get the real-world skills you need to actually start building Android apps.  

[**Android Developer**](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801):  
> For intermediate Java developers pursuing Android specialization, this program teaches the tools, principles, and patterns that underlie all Android development.&nbsp; The skills you learn in this Nanodegree program will help you master the existing platform, and prepare you for the exciting opportunities in Android's future.  
> ...  
> We built this Nanodegree program in partnership with Google specifically to support aspiring Android Developers.&nbsp; The curriculum is designed to transform those with intermediate skills and a working knowledge of Java development best practices into specialists with the Android platform.&nbsp; Successful completion of the program means a diverse portfolio of projects to show employers, an established credential to affirm your achievements, and your own app on the Google Play Store.&nbsp; If your goal is employment as an Android Developer, this program is exactly what you need to succeed.  

See [**this article**](http://blog.udacity.com/2016/05/breaking-down-how-a-nanodegree-program-works.html) on Udacity's blog for more information.

&nbsp; 

> ### I'm interested in working through a Nanodegree program, but can't afford to pay the $200-300 monthly fee for 6-12 months.&nbsp; Is there a more affordable way to get a Nanodegree?

[**According to Udacity's blog**](http://blog.udacity.com/2015/06/how-you-can-afford-the-nanodegree.html), you can work through the [**course material**](#nanodegree-outlines) for free, and then go back & complete the actual Nanodegree program in 2 months ( *the minimum enrollment period* ).

Additionally, you have two options on how you could go about this:

[**Nanodegree**](https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree)  
`Graduate in 12 months, get a 50% tuition refund`

($199/month × 2) - 50% refund =  
$199 total

[**Nanodegree Plus**](https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree/plus)  
`Get hired or receive a full tuition refund`

($299/month × 2) =  
$598 total ( *assuming you manage to find a job within 6 months of completing the program* )  
OR  
$0 total ( *assuming you did not find a job, and meet the terms of the Nanodegree Plus program* )  

&nbsp;

> ### The course names on this page are different from the ones on Udacity.&nbsp; How can I find a course based on its actual name?

Course listings on this page were renamed to provide a context that shows course relationships.

The `# Full Curriculum (Details)` section on the [**raw Markdown**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Enteleform/-RES-/master/%5BLinks%5D/%5BAndroid%5D%20Udacity%20Curriculum.md) page can be used to reference actual course names.

If you want to check a specific course against the context-based names: the fastest way is probably to use your web browser's search function and paste the course name from the URL.&nbsp; [**For example**](http://imgur.com/BVKhIHO), `developing-android-apps` instead of `Developing Android Apps`.

# Notes

Several of the original course overviews are somewhat vague. Be aware that:  
* Project lists are approximated. There might be some variance in actual projects per course.  
* Some of the projects are not specific to a single course, and will be worked on several times throughout the entirety of the curriculum.  
* I took a few liberties with the course & project names to provide concise, informative descriptions; while maintaining & interpreting the original contexts to the best of my ability.  
	
Most of the details in the reference were taken directly from Udacity's web page. These details are potentially subject to change, so you should refer directly to the relevant [**Udacity**](https://www.udacity.com/) pages to make sure that the listed information is still accurate. I especially recommend doing so if you plan on starting one of the paid Nanodegree programs based on the information provided here.
